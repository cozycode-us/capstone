This is an idea for how we could seperate our requirements into classes and methods to be better able to reference them. Feel free to make any additions or adjustments! 



Class - Parking

- openspace array?
methods

Class - Ticket
(contains all methods for output of a ticket including an assigned parking space as well as the
time the space became occupied—and potentially when user is expected to leave—as well as features of
the designated car ie. color, type, registration numer)
